# OneDB: A Distributed Multi-Metric Data Similarity Search System

## Overview

**OneDB** is a high-performance, distributed similarity search framework built to handle large-scale **multi-modal** and **multi-metric** data. This system enables efficient multi-metric **range** and **k-nearest neighbor (kNN)** queries by leveraging flexible indexing strategies and automatic parameter tuning. Designed for use cases across healthcare, e-commerce, and other domains, OneDB supports a variety of data types and distance metrics.

### Key Features:
- **Multi-Metric Weight Learning:** A lightweight learning model captures the importance of different modalities dynamically.
- **Dual-Layer Indexing:** A two-level index structure ensures both global partitioning and optimized local search.
- **End-to-End Parameter Tuning:** Deep reinforcement learning optimizes system performance automatically.

## Development Environment

We recommend **IntelliJ IDEA** for development, with Spark and Hadoop setup following the [official guide](http://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html).

### Steps:
1. Install Spark and Hadoop dependencies.
2. Configure Maven projects with:
    - **Profiles:** `hadoop-2.6`, `hive-provided`, `yarn`
3. Reimport and generate sources using **Maven Projects** in IntelliJ.
4. Mark generated sources as appropriate:
   - `target/scala-2.11/src_managed/main/compiled_avro` for `spark-streaming-flume-sink`.
   - `src/gen/java` for `spark-hive-thriftserver`.

## Example Usage

To perform similarity search using OneDB's SQL interface:  

**1. Multi-Metric Range Query:**
```sql
SELECT * FROM my_table WHERE col IN ODBRANGE(query_point, weight_vector, radius);
```

**2. Multi-Metric kNN Query:**
```sql
SELECT * FROM my_table WHERE col IN ODBKNN(query_point, weight_vector, k);
```

## Datasets

| **Dataset** | **Size**  | **Metric** | **Link**                                                     |
| ----------- | --------- | ---------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Air Quality | 1,150,000 | 13         | [Link](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rohanrao/air-quality-data-in-india) |
| Food        | 38,757    | 9          | [Link](https://world.openfoodfacts.org/data)                 |
| Rental      | 113,176   | 5          | [Link](https://www.kaggle.com/c/two-sigma-connect-rental-listing-inquiries) |

Datasets are stored in **TXT** format and can be accessed from HDFS or a local directory. Each row represents one data point with dimensions separated by spaces.

## How to Run

1. **Build the Project:**
   
   ```bash
   mvn clean install
   ```
   
2. **Launch OneDB with Spark:**
   ```bash
   spark-submit --class org.apache.spark.examples.sql.onedb.ODBMultiDataFrameExample --master yarn
   ```

3. **Test SQL Queries:** Use Spark SQL CLI or connect to a running Spark instance.
